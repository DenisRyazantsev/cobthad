## Motivation

I wanted to write down my conclusions for each book chapter as anki-cards and keep them in the handy deck.

## FAQ

### What book formats does it support?

Only PDF files.

### I tried to use the add-on with my PDF file but it can't find headers. Why? 

Not all PDF files contain the titles as metadata so the add-on cannot process it. Try to find a different version of 
your PDF file, or you can make the titles yourself.
